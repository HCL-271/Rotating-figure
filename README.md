# Rotating-figure
I want to try some ASCII grafics with rotating torus.
The idea of this rep is my ammempt to explain graphics to myself, and add some comments.
As base I used this donut

You can compile and run this code with the following command
 gcc main.c -o donut -lm;./donut
 But it also works on https://www.onlinegdb.com/
